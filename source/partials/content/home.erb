                    <p>Stratum reduces the barrier to entry for digital health companies by making HIPAA compliance as easy as git push. As the Director of Design at Catalyze I spent more than two years leading a team of designers in making Stratum the number one compliance platform as a service.</p>
                    <p>Over the course of two and half years I worked directly with the product and engineering teams at Catalyze to design and deliver Stratum.</p>
