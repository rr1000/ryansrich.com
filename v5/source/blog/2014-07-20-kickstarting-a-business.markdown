> **NOTE:** I am in no way taking credit for 'developing' this business method. I am simply drawing parallels to the subjects and technologies that I'm interested in. Many of these practices have been in use for decades [1], [2].

Creating a business whether it be a digital startup or a brick and mortar retail store requires some amount of capital (even time spent building a product is a capital investment). Physical businesses typically self-fund but it's not uncommon for a restaurant to go to a VC firm or to find other investors that are willing to take a stake in their company [3], [4]. Tech startups tend to reach for funding through accelerator programs and/or angel investors. There are of course many startups (both tech and non-tech) that are [bootstrapped](http://37signals.com/bootstrapped).

I think it's safe to assume that the overwhelming majority of funded startups have a **good** idea. That is, an idea that people are attracted to. An idea that is solving a real problem. <span class="hl">And most importantly an idea that is creating customers</span>. If we can agree with that assumption then we are left with another; startups fail for x, but x is not a lack of a good idea. Therefore I think it's safe to say that good, even great, are not the end all be all of the startup world. However I wouldn't go so far as to say they are worthless [5].

One of the best tests to see if you do in fact have a good idea is to talk to people about it. In practice this is great. You'll most likely receive a ton of valuable feedback. Talking with people, and not just anybody but potential users, is such an important step that it's one of the fundamental ideas of the lean startup process [6]. However if we go back to our assumption that x is not a lack of a good idea then what's the importance of talking with people (other than to confirm that you're in the 10th percentile)? To grossly oversimplify the answer to this question it's **finding money**. When you talk with potential users and customers your goal should be to find their money and make them give it to you. "Are they willing to pay for it?" should be at the forefront of your mind when talking with people about your business idea.

The reason this is so important is that having someone love your product and say they'd use it is a complete false reality. Until their money makes it into your bank account take everything they say with a hefty dose of salt. Having this mindset from the very beginning also forces the founding team to focus on the only thing that matters in the business world, performance. Which is often measured by financial, institutional and organizational success. (of course Silicon Valley has shown some very odd behavior in the last 3-6 years in which [companies that hemorrhage money are raising insane IPOs](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=TWTR) but I wouldn't count on that trend to continue for another 5 years).

Because you're focusing on the one thing that matters in business ($) you'll most likely deliver a product that people love (that's why they're giving you money for it). If you can't find people to give you money you are either a.) delivering a sub-par product or b.) in the consumer space. If you're in the consumer space I have no advice for you besides...good luck (which of course is no advice at all). On the other hand if you're delivering a sub-par product then you know that it's time to go back to the drawing board. This doesn't necessarily mean that everything about your product is wrong. It could be as simple as one killer feature, but it's important to realize this early on before too much time is spent on engineering a product that no one wants.

So how do you get people to give you money if you don't even have a product yet? The good thing about B2B business models is that if you can truly show how your product improves a companies performance (no matter how small of a contribution to that uptick) they'll more than likely pay you for it. If you're delivering a product that greatly improves their performance (combined with a price insensitive market like healthcare, government contracting, etc.) they'll even give you money upfront. This is what I identify as a 'kickstarting' business model. I use the word 'kickstart' because it essentially follows the same principles that guide crowd funding platforms (like kickstarter). You prototype a product, promote it, and then collect money from people with the promise that you'll deliver something in the end.

The initial sales cycle looks something like this:

- Idea (Creating a solution to a problem. Creating a customer)
- Research (Talking with industry insiders, most likely not those with purchasing power but those that have intimate knowledge about the market)
- Prototype (Non-functional but polished)
- Sell (Talking with industry insiders that have purchasing power)
- Refine (Once you've sold a few units you'll most likely have feature requests that keep coming up. Good thing you haven't built anything yet)
- Build (Starting with feature priority)
- Release (Release versions of the product to your new customers incrementally) **
- Deliver (A polished product)

** By giving early access to the product you help ensure customer satisfaction as well as giving a sense of importance. When you're selling you'll typically provide the customer with a rough delivery date (e.g. 6 months). If at 3 months you have 50% of the product built you should fork that and deliver it to your customers early with the expectation that you are releasing a preliminary beta to loyal early adopters. In most cases they'll be pleasantly surprised that they are receiving part of the product 3 months ahead of schedule. A tangentially related benefit of this step is that you can solicit feedback that you can incorporate into the final release.

The 'kickstart' method has obvious benefits:

- You have a customer
- You're creating a product with value
- You develop a performance driven culture
