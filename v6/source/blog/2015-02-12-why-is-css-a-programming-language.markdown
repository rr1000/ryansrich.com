I was checking out a new tool yesterday called [GitHunt](http://githut.info/) and noticed something peculiar about the language column. It included CSS. I usually wouldn't have given anything like this a second thought however I distinctly remember from college that HTML and CSS were strictly not programming languages.

The reason why CSS is noted as a programming language in Githunt is because the Github API references it as such. If you've ever explored the language bar in Github you'd notice that CSS is considered a programming language right along side JavaScript, Ruby, etc.

Now the discussion of whether or not CSS and HTML are programming languages has been had, several times. The consensus is usually that CSS is a programming language but was never intended to be, while HTML is not. In 2015 we have all sorts of frameworks and templating languages that allow us to definitively say CSS is in fact a programming language, or at least can be used as such. While things like Angular have really allowed us to expand HTML into a programming language, however HTML by itself carries no such properties.
