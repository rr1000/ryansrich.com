			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I attended Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) where I studied Visual Design, and Web Development. I received a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Arts and Science. After graduating, I was a Web Developer at Global Thinking, a creative agency in the Washington DC area.</p>

			<p>I currently work for Catalyze where I'm helping developers build the future of healthcare software. As a remote employee, I am able to travel the U.S. with my girlfriend, Kara. We currently reside in Portland, OR. Our previous destinations include Rochester, NY and Alexandria, VA.</p>
