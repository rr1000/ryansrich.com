# RRICH.IO

## Hello:

**What?** This is my personal website and portfolio. It's built with middleman. I use NPM to build assets and run middleman commands from a single interface.

**How?** Just ensure you have some version of node and ruby 2.* . You can then run the follow to get going:

- `$ npm i`
- `$ bundle`
- `$ npm boom`

## Full list of commands:

| Command | Action |
| `build` | This command runs `bundle exec middleman build` to build the static output from Middleman. |
| `sass`  | This command runs node sass. |
| `serve` | This command runs the built in middleman server. |
| `watch` | This command watches for changes to style files. |
| `boom`  | This command runs all the commands concurrently. |
